Problem: 

Some time changes in configuration may lead to bugs that ignored by unit tests, especially in enviornment where the configuration changes frequently.

Therefore, I deployed configuration test to Apache Spark's core module, a highly configured project that have morethan 300 different configuration parameter and more than 3000 unit tests.

Summary: 
https://github.com/xlab-uiuc/openctest/pull/20
To deploy the configuration tests, I first tested the SET/GET API of the original project.

For the GET/SET API, I added code to the SparkConf object to record the configuration parameters involved in the unit tests.
I also modified some functions in the openctest framework to support running scala tests and collecting data from scala tests.

To inject CTest parameters, I added and modified some functions in the openctet framework.
The injection does not require modifications to Spark's source code, so there is no need to use patches to inject.

At the same time, I edited many codes in openctest to support projects that written in Scala.

My openctest repo:
https://github.com/ZHLOLin/openctest

Results: 
Add support for the spark core module in the openctest framework.
Instrument the Spark core module(Intercept/Logging).

Collect Configuration Parameters and Tests for spark core module.
Automate Project Installation.
Successfully generated the parameter mapping for Spark core module.
Generated ctest for 30 parameters using the scripts.

Total Effort: 
I spent around 9 hours per weeks doing the project.
I spend a lot of time understanding how spark organize configurations.
Testing modified openctest framework is also time consuming.

Questions:

1.What are the pain points in working on the configuration project?

Since I work on a large and complex open source software, understanding the source code is really difficult and time consuming.
Also, editing the openctest framework is quite difficult because there are not many comments in the source code.

2.How much time does the project take in total and what is the most time-consuming part?

Around 100-105 hours in total.
Generating the mapping and implementing injection.

3.What part of the original Ctest model works well and what works poorly?

I think generate value and generate ctest works well.
These 2 modules will automatically generate reasonable configuration values to check if the selected unit test is CTest.
Manual testing takes too much time, especially for projects with a lot of unit tests, so an automation script can significantly reduce the time required.

However, I think identify parameters is not that good. Generating mappings takes too much time and the user must manually select the trace that should be ignored.

4.How good or bad is the Ctest prototype?

I think the current Ctest prototype is good enough. It is able to find configuration parameters that "avoid" unit tests. However, the current Ctest prototype is not efficient enough.

How often/efficiently can Ctest pinpoint the BAD value of the parameters?

Not very efficient. The user has to run ctest manually with many different bad values, which is quite time consuming.

If you are the boss of one famous project (spark, nifi, etc...) Are you willing to spend some time supporting the configuration testing for the project? Why or Why not?

I will take the time to support configuration tests. Some unit tests use hard-coded configuration values, so some bad configuration values may go undetected. These bad values may lead to serious production failures in the future.

Is there any disadvantages of applying the configuration testing to more projects?

I have no reason to reject changes that would make my project better.

*How does Ctest fit into other programing language (not Java)?

Some Ctest scripts use hard-coded maven commands and report parsers, assuming the project supports surefire reporting. So I have to change many functions and add new parameter to it. The scalatest also support white space in test name, so a simple split function is not enough to parse scala test.
