# For Cassandra
## Problem
Cassandra does not support configuration tests, it may be broken when configuration changes in production environment.

## Summary
I added the configuration test for Cassandra using the openctest framework. The framework can be used to generate the ctest-mapping, which contains configuration parameters and their associated test methods. And user can also inject configuration values and rerun the tests to verify the behavior of the tests with different configuration values.

## Questions to Answer
1. What are the pain points in working on the configuration project?
- The most challenging part of this project is to understand how the target project loads and interacts with the configuration values. For Cassandra, all configuration values are stored in the Config class instance, to load the configuration, we can use the build-in FromYaml function, but it won't merge multiple yaml file, any later loading will replace the entire configuration setting in the previous loading, so I have to modify the source code to merge default configuration file and the ctest injected configuration file.

2. How much time does the project take in total and what is the most time-consuming part?
- Roughly 60+ hours are spent on this project. The most time-consuming part is to modify the original openctest framework. Because the framework is designed to run with Maven-based project, however, Cassandra uses Ant to manage the project, so there are some big changes needed to be done.

3. What part of the original Ctest model works well and what works poorly?
- I think that in general, ctest model works well with Cassandra. However, for generate-value module, I don't think it is generic enough, it requires specific domain knowledge, for example, -1 is a valid integer, but it does not make any sense for a num_tokens configuration.

4. How good or bad is the Ctest prototype?
- For project like Hadoop, it work quite well, I find some Bad value in the mp2. But for Cassandra, it does not work quite as effective. Cassandra has relatively strict verification on the configuration value already, for example, if I inject 88888 into a network_port configuration value, the test will fail with the error message tell you that 88888 is not a valid port number. Therefore, it is hard to use Ctest to find any Bad value that passes.
- To be honest, if I were the maintainer of one large project, I probably won't support configuration testing for the project. First of all, large project typically has very complex inner-connection among different modules. If there were some changes in one module, I may need to rerun the entire ctest to get the latest mapping information, which could be costly. Secondly, just like Cassandra, if the project has already implement verification on configuration value, using ctest to find bad value may add less value to the project.

6. How does Ctest fit into different build/testing system beyond Maven (Ant / Gradle)?
- I don't think there is any problem for Ctest to fit in different build/testing system. The concept stays the same, just we need to modify the source code to achieve that.

# For Redisson
## Problem
- As there are some configuration tunings can be done in redisson, we decided to implement Ctest in redisson and see how each configuration parameter can affect the application

## Summary
- Successfully generate mapping of configuration parameters and its corresponding test method for redisson
- able to create new YAML file and inject the parameters into redisson

## Questions to Answer
1. Pain points in working on the configuration project
- The development set up can be confusing sometimes. Especially when if the application is always fetching the latest dependencies, it can cause some tests to fail. For example, Spring had a release on 11/15 which is in the middle of semester; Redisson was fetching the latest dependency but its code is still in Java 11.
- In redisson, the configuration parameters were split across different module, but ctest apparently only supports injecting in 1 configuration file.
- In most of the project, configuration parameters' getter and setter are usually defined separately. Adding log to each getter and setter can be time consuming.

2. How much time does the project take in total and what is the most time-consuming part
- It takes about 60 hours, and the most time-consuming part is running the generate_ctest and generate mapping. Both take about 1 day to complete the job with the chance of failure (network issue/memory issue/code defect/etc.)

3. What part of the original Ctest model works well and what works poorly?
- Despite the run-time of mapping generating, ctest does a decent job of testing customized configuration parameter.
- The Ctest model gather all the getter and setter info from the log, but it can be time consuming to individually implement each getter/setter method if they are defined separately.
- When generating random config parameter, I think the parameter with boolean value should be skipped.

4. How good or bad is the Ctest prototype?
- Feature to add: support other building system, such as ant.
- Feature to add: support multiple configuration files loading since all configuration parameters might not be defined in a single module
- Some generic scripts to generate `test_method_list.json` and `conf_params.txt` for generating mapping.
- An option with running randomly selected tests would be nice as running the whole test takes time.
