# Problem: 
    The project for Ctest I make most progress on is rocketmq.
    Rocketmq is a cloud-native "messaging, eventing, streaming" real-time data processing platform, covering cloud-edge-device collaboration scenarios. 
    
# Summary: 
    First, I worked on finding the project and target the configuration functions. Rocketmq is my decision for this step.
    Secondly, I worked on finding/testing the SET/GET methods. I investigated the code of generate mapping and prepared the conf_params.txt and test_method_list.json files for map generating. 
    Thirdly, I faced some problems trying to generate the mapping result. The problem is fixed by change the setting in the pom file and the map is generated well. 
    a.Results: 
        Map generated both for acl module and client module.
        The mapping injection is not done for this project.
        
# Total effort:
    My effort for this project should be 6-8 hours per week.
    Since I am not in CS major, some of the main concepts are not so clear to me.
    I spent a lot of time understanding the technical terms and searching for related infomation. 
    Besides, to understand the open source project is diffcult and time comsuming for me. 
    I also make effort on learning Jave's environment and syntax, cause I did not use Java that often before.

# Longer Description:
    For step 2 in summary, the automation script I used to generate the test_method_list.json is in (https://github.com/BlueSaNGG/test_method_list_Script).
    For step 3 in summary, the mapping result of two modules for rocketmq acl module (https://github.com/Stranger3333/IDoCT/tree/acl/generate_mapping/results/rocketmq-acl) and client module(https://github.com/Stranger3333/IDoCT/tree/client%26container/generate_mapping/results/rocketmq-client).
